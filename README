A program which draws a teapot with two light sources (based on Professor Shafae's hello_glsl program)
The light sources are white and the program uses the vertex and fragment shaders to position the verticies and color their resulting fragments, respectively. 
The color of the fragments are based on the following formula: C=W((cos0 + 1)/2)^P where 0 is the angle between the eye vector and the reflection vector, R. 

This is done for every color component:
	For red, W = P = 1.
	For green, W = 1 and P = 2. 
	For blue, W = 1 and P = 20. 
	Where R = 2N(N*L) - L.

Possible defect:
The requirements say that the bronze.vert.glsl is the vertex shader for your Gourand shader but it also states to calculate the color once per pixel like a Phong shader. I've programmed using the Phong shader instead.
